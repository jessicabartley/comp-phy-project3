## Big CS concepts

1.  Decompose the problem into smaller components, which can be easily tested
    and verified.
2.  Self documenting code
3.  Classes and objects
4.  Regular expressions

## Installation

This has been tested on OS X  10.9.2. What a pain in the a**!

```
brew install python gfortran freetype
ln -s /usr/local/include/freetype2 /usr/local/include/freetype
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install matplotlib
```
