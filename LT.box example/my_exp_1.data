# this is a file with test data
# it is used to show hoe to enter data
# and how to work with them later
#
# assume they represent time and distance (dist)
# measurements and each has its own error
#
# add the header lines below,
# notice you can have an empty line inbetween

#! time[f,0]/ dist[f,1]/ d_err[f,2]/
0.0   3.5 1.1
1.0   4.6 1.2
2.0   8.0 1.
3.0  11.4 1.5
