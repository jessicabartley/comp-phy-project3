# Computational Physics Projects

## Installation

Using the [LabTools][] package to plot graphs, which relies on some [SciPy][]
packages. This has been tested on OS X  10.9.2. What a pain in the a**!

```
brew install python gfortran freetype
ln -s /usr/local/include/freetype2 /usr/local/include/freetype
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
